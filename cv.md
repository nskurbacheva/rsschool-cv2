A year ago I visited courses on HTML, CSS, JS. Although I did not manage to reach a success, I understood that this is a field where I would like to develop and be successful.  This job looks tempting for me because I will learn something new all the time and work with highly professional goal oriented people. Moreover I enjoy this type of activity when you need  to find the best solution to solve the task and see the result of what you have done.

**Code examples and experience:** I can not show off with any experience and code examples in this field now, but I will try to improve situation soon.
